# Capstone

The capstone project is your opportunity to demonstrate your Web Development skills by creating a full stack application. You will work individually to create an e-commerce site, including all the MVP features and adding as many extra features as time allows.

If you would like to work as a team you will need to complete the group application and submit in Canvas by Friday 2/16 so that we can evaluate it and approve / deny before Monday.
