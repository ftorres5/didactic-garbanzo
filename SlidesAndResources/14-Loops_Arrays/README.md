# Block 14: Loops and Arrays

The starting code for the in-class demo can be found [here](./demo/README.md)

The solution code for this block can be found within the [SolutionCode](../../SolutionCode/14-Loops_Arrays/README.md) folder

Since there were some differences between the slides I lectured on and in Canvas the slides I used in my lecture can be found [here](./block14_slides_Loops_Arrays.pdf)

## Objectives: 
* Define how arrays are used to organize data.
* Use indexes to access and modify individual elements of an array.
* Read and write code that uses loops.
* Use loops to iterate through an array.
* Distinguish between for and while loops.
