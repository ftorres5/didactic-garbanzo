# Complete Frontend Review

You will build a React Application that works with an API to help a user log their plants and the plants' watering schedule so that they can make sure to water the plants on time.

## Marketing Prompt
Ensuring that all your plants are consistently watered is actually pretty difficult. Water My Plants is an app that helps to solve those problems.

With an easy to use interface for creating a plant watering schedule tailored to each individual plant, WaterMyPlants will remind users when it's time to feed that foliage and quench your plants' thirst.

## User Stories 

Based on the marketing prompt the following user stories have been devised for MVP (minimum viable product) and additional features once MVP is met. 

Note that the user stories are the same for the Frontend and Backend so that they can work together to deliver a working application. 

### Tier 1: MVP

AS a non-authenticated user, I should be able to: 

* Access the website via the internet and see a nice home page describing the application
* Be able to log in or register as a new user 

AS an authenticated user, I should be able to: 

* See a list of all of my plants
* See details about any of my plants 
* Create a new plant AND enter the following plant information:
    - plant species
    - water frequency for that plant
    - plant nick-name
    - image of the plant 
* Edit an existing plant 
* Remove a plant from my list
* See my account information
* Be able to logout without refreshing the browser

### Tier 2: Stretch
Optional: you can select all or none of these features to implement

* Notify a user via email when it's time to water their plant(s)
* All website features usable no matter my device type (phone, tablet, laptop, desktop)
* UI tailored to my device size (phone, tablet, laptop, desktop)
* Know when content is loading or if there is an error, so I can manage my expectations as a user
* As an authenticated user have the ability to:
    * Edit my account information
    * Delete my account and all my plant information
    * Add notes about my plants 
    * Re-arrange the order I see my plants 
    * Filter my plants by any attribute 

## Planning 
* Create a repo (if you don't have one already) for this project
* Create a Github Project and associate it with that repo

## User Experience (UX) Planning
* Create a quick mockup (aka wireframe) for each page that a user will interact with
    - each page should take less than 10 minutes to mock up
    - You can doodle on paper, use [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), [whimiscal](https://whimsical.com/) or any other application to help create a mock up
    - Wireframes are NOT about styling. Wireframes are about how the components are spaced on the page. 

Now that we have an idea of what we want as our application we can create tasks in our Github project for each page. We can break down the components within each page to give us a better way to tackle completeing each page in our project. 

Now that all the tasks (or at least a majority) are created we can start programming our application
