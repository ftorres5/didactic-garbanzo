# The Zoo Problem 
The Wild Animal Mini-Zoo recently hired many new zookeeper interns who will work at the zoo for the next six months. They have contracted your team to build a page that will make it easier for the new interns to identify each animal and understand their needs and behaviors.

## Requirements
* Incorporate major HTML semantic tags, i.e., header, footer, article, section, and summary.
* Create a main header of what this page will do.
* Add a title for the browser tab.
* Add a heading for each animal type. There are five types of animals.
    1. Bears
        1. Ollie
        2. Mona
    2. Giraffes
        1. Frankie
        2. Coconut
    3. Lions
        1. Mella
        2. Karl
    4. Monkeys
        1. Cookie
        2. Earl
        3. Banana Pudding
    5. Alligators
        1. Wren
        2. Aspen
        3. Mika
* Add the names of each animal in a list format.
* Add a description for each animal and use a paragraph, section, or article tag.
* Create a link for each animal that goes to an external fact page of that particular animal so the zookeeper can quickly find out more information. These external pages can link to other outside websites.
* Add a photo for each animal.
* Include appropriate comments so that the code is easier for others to read and understand.
