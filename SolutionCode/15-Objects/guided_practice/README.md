# Block 15: Guided Practice

You will be writing JavaScript code for this guided practice. Start by creating a new folder and an HTML file. You can write your code directly in a `<script>` tag or in a separate .js file. Live serve the HTML so you can check your work in the browser console. 

You and your friends go out to eat for dinner at the new JavaScript Pub. You talk, laugh, and reminisce about the old days. Unfortunately, when you get the check, it is smeared with an array of sauces, making it unreadable. Instead of asking for a reprint, you decide to problem-solve and discover the total for yourself.

You ask your friends what they ate, and you receive the following information.

* You ate a cheeseburger for $12.
* Jonah had the $20 steak.
* Amy's soup cost $8.
* Mateo did not like his mac and cheese for $14.
* Cheyenne was impressed by the unlimited soup and salad combo for $16.

# Steps 
1. Declare an object named dinner that uses the purchased food as the keys and the price of the food for the values.
2. Using the dinner object, list all of the different foods that were eaten during the dinner.
3. Using the dinner object, list the prices of the meals eaten during the dinner.
4. Using what we know about objects, add the values of the dinner object to calculate the total cost of the meal. 
5. Convert the answer for the previous question into a function that returns the total cost of any object that is shaped like dinner.
