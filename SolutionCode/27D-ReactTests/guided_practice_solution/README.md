# Guided Practice - Jest

This React app contains a single checkbox component with a label that changes depending on the state of the checkbox. Your task for this guided practice is to test that the label changes when the checkbox is clicked.

This activity is based on the [example available in the Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react#dom-testing).

## Instructions

1. Explore the app in the browser via `npm run dev`.
2. Read the code in `src/Checkbox.jsx` to understand how the component is built.
   - How is the label of the checkbox determined?
   - What event causes the label to change?
3. Complete the empty test case in `src/__tests__/Checkbox.test.jsx` according to the instructions in the file.
   - Reference the Testing Library documentation on [queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about) and [firing events](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-events).
