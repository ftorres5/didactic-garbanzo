# Block 33 SQL: Guided Practice

Following our PostgreSQL download and installation, let us begin by creating a dedicated database for this project:

## Guided Pracctice

1. Create a new database called `vetclinic`
Now, let us work with the API.
2. Navigate to the top folder that contains `package.json`.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run seed` to seed the database.
5. Run `npm start` to start the server.

## Objectives

* Create a RESTful API with Express with try / catch blocks to handle errors. 
* Implement TDD on the CRUD routes supported by the API using Postman. 
* Use body-parser to parse the body of a request. 
* Use the pg module to connect to a PostgreSQL database and perform CRUD operations.
