# Block 27B: Expanded React I

Guided in-class project for Block 27B: Expanded React I

In this project we will learn about Redux Toolkit using a previous project (ToDos)

# Introduction
We are going to build upon our To Do Task List from block 27. 

We are going to be using a mock Todo List API. The base url for the todos is at `https://todo-api-ur6k.onrender.com/api/todos`

The object of a todo for this API is: 

```json
{
    "id": 1, 
    "task": "A good to do",
    "completed": false
}
```

When adding a to do using the API only the `task` key is required in our request.
